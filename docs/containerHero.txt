The Visual Monolith (The Engine Terminal)
In your earlier draft, you had a brilliant section of text that said:

Phase 1 Live | ACTIVE PROJECT: E-commerce Platform | SYSTEM METRICS: Startup Time: Instant | CODE PREVIEW...

You need to take that concept and turn it into a massive, visual "Command Center" graphic directly below the Hero button.

How to design it (No code, just layout):
The Container: Create a massive, wide rectangle that spans almost the entire width of the screen. Give it a deep Machine Surface (#141414) background and a 1px solid Milled Steel (#262626) border. Give it slightly rounded, precise corners (e.g., 8px).
The Layout (Split Screen): Split this container into two vertical halves.
The Left Side (The Directive): Make this look like a dark, raw terminal or code editor. Show the "Input." Use your Geist Mono or IBM Plex Mono font. Show a raw text directive generating an enterprise architecture. (e.g., Initializing EU-Compliance Runtime... Compiling Role-Based Access... Deploying Database...)
The Right Side (The Output): Show the result. A highly dense, ultra-clean UI component. Show a snippet of a data table (like an HVAC permit log or a maritime shipping manifest) to prove that the engine actually builds complex B2B infrastructure.
The Status Bar: At the very top or bottom of this container, put a tiny, horizontal status bar.
Add a blinking Forge Amber (#E54826) dot.
Text next to it: SYSTEM ONLINE. PHASE 1 ACTIVE.
Why this specific layout is mandatory:
It proves capability: The Texas HVAC owner or Swedish logistics CEO does not want to read about how your AI works. They want to see that it generates secure data tables and compliance dashboards.
It grounds the brand: By making the interface look like a dark terminal, you reinforce the "industrial machinery" vibe. It doesn't look like a toy app; it looks like a power grid control panel.
The Page Flow Check
If you build this, your page flow will be flawless:
The Hero: "Engineering the end of legacy software." (The Hook)
The Visual Monolith: The massive, dark UI terminal showing the engine at work. (The Proof)
The Manifesto: "Speed is no longer a feature..." (The Philosophy)
The Architecture: "Proprietary technology..." (The Details)

Top Bar: The System Status
Create a very thin, dark border (Milled Steel #262626) separating this top bar from the rest of the container. Use small, Schematic Gray (#9CA3AF) text.

[Left Aligned Text]:
RIVTOR_KERNEL_v2.4.1

[Right Aligned Text]:
[●] SYSTEM: ONLINE    REGION: EU-WEST    LATENCY: 42ms
(Note: Make the [●] dot your Forge Amber #E54826 color to draw the eye).

Left Pane: The Directive (Input)
This side represents the raw, uncompromising power of the Rivtor Engine. It shows how a complex architecture is ordered into existence. Use High-Tensile White (#F3F4F6) for the commands, and Schematic Gray for the parameters.

// DIRECTIVE_INPUT
> INITIALIZE: Enterprise_Runtime_Environment

> TARGET_ARCHITECTURE:
TYPE: ISO-9001_Compliance_Dashboard
SCOPE: Multi-Facility_Audit_Logging

> ENFORCE_PROTOCOLS:
DATA_RESIDENCY: EU-Frankfurt (Strict)
IDENTITY: @rivtor/auth
RBAC_LEVELS: [Global_Admin, Facility_Manager, Floor_Operator]

> INJECT_SCHEMA:
TABLE 01: Material_Batches (Relational)
TABLE 02: Inspection_Logs (Immutable)
TABLE 03: Corrective_Actions (Trigger_Alerts)

> EXECUTE_DEPLOYMENT: INSTANTANEOUS

Right Pane: The Output (Live Environment)
This side proves the engine works. It is a dense, highly structured data table. It shows the client exactly what they are getting: a clean, usable, unsexy B2B dashboard.

// LIVE_ENVIRONMENT : FACILITY_04_DASHBOARD

[Mockup a Clean Data Table here. Give it a subtle Milled Steel border.]

Table Headers (Schematic Gray):
BATCH_ID  |  TIMESTAMP (UTC)  |  QC_STATUS  |  OPERATOR_ID  |  ENCRYPTION

Row 1 (High-Tensile White):
BT-8902A  |  2026-02-22 08:14 |  VERIFIED   |  USR-492      |  SHA-256

Row 2 (High-Tensile White):
BT-8903B  |  2026-02-22 09:30 |  AUDIT_REQ  |  USR-118      |  SHA-256
(Note: Make the text AUDIT_REQ your Forge Amber color to show a system warning state).

Row 3 (High-Tensile White):
BT-8904C  |  2026-02-22 10:45 |  VERIFIED   |  USR-044      |  SHA-256

Bottom of Right Pane (Small, Schematic Gray text):
INFRASTRUCTURE: SERVERLESS_EDGE
DB_SYNC: REALTIME
EXPORT_READY: TRUE

The Psychology of this Layout:
No "Magic Wand" Icons: We do not use magic sparkles or "AI" emojis. The left pane looks like a military-grade system command. It respects the intelligence of the enterprise buyer.
The "Immutable" and "SHA-256" Keywords: The Texas HVAC owner might not know what SHA-256 encryption is, but the IT director at the Swedish Dev Agency absolutely does. It screams security and compliance.
The Contrast: The raw code/directive on the left perfectly contrasts with the clean, structured table on the right. It visually explains the value proposition without requiring the user to read a single paragraph of marketing copy.
