1. The Layout Logic: Stack, Do Not Split
On desktop, you have a left pane (Input) and a right pane (Output). On mobile, this must become a strict vertical stack.
The Directive (Input) sits at the top.
A horizontal Milled Steel (#262626) divider separates them.
The Live Environment (Output) sits at the bottom.
2. The Top Bar: Ruthless Trimming
Your mobile top bar is currently squished. You must hide non-essential data on mobile.
Left side: RIVTOR_KERNEL_v2.4.1
Right side: [●] SYSTEM: ONLINE
Action: Hide REGION: EU-WEST and LATENCY: 42ms on mobile screens entirely. They are secondary metrics and clutter the void.
3. The Directive (Input Pane)
The code input works well vertically, but you must ensure the text does not break the container.
Action: Apply text-wrapping logic to your container so long lines (like the RBAC_LEVELS array) wrap cleanly to the next line instead of pushing the box wider than the screen.
Padding: Reduce the padding. On desktop you might have 40px of padding; on mobile, reduce it to 16px or 20px so the text utilizes the full width of the phone.
4. The Output Pane: Kill the Table
This is the most critical fix. You cannot use a horizontal <table> on mobile. You must convert the table rows into Stacked Data Logs.

Instead of a horizontal row, each batch entry becomes its own distinct block of text.

Structure each log entry like this:

[ BATCH_ID: BT-8902A ]
TIME: 2026-02-22 08:14 (UTC)
STATUS: VERIFIED
OPERATOR: USR-492 | ENCRYPTION: SHA-256
(Add a dashed Milled Steel line here to separate from the next log)

[ BATCH_ID: BT-8903B ]
TIME: 2026-02-22 09:30 (UTC)
STATUS: AUDIT_REQ (Keep this in Forge Amber)
OPERATOR: USR-118 | ENCRYPTION: SHA-256

Why this works: It maintains the monospace, terminal aesthetic but adapts perfectly to a vertical scroll. It looks like a live server log rather than a broken spreadsheet.

5. The Bottom Metrics
At the bottom of the Output pane, you currently have three metrics side-by-side (INFRASTRUCTURE, DB_SYNC, EXPORT_READY).
Action: Stack these vertically on mobile, aligned to the left.
The Execution
Go into your CSS framework (like Tailwind). You will use standard breakpoints to say: "If the screen is mobile, stack the columns vertically and render the Data Logs. If the screen is desktop, display the split-pane horizontal table."

This ensures the mobile user sees a highly optimized, readable server log, while the desktop user sees the massive compliance dashboard.
