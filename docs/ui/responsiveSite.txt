Looking at your design system doc, here is every change needed to make the Cold Fusion landing page fully responsive. Apply these in order.

---

**1. PAGE WRAPPER — reduce section gap on mobile**

The `gap-20` between sections is the biggest offender on mobile. Change the main wrapper to:

```
gap-12 md:gap-16 lg:gap-20
px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-12
py-12 md:py-20
```

---

**2. NAVBAR — add mobile menu**

Currently nav links and buttons are hidden on mobile with `hidden sm:flex`. You need a hamburger menu. The pattern:

- On mobile: show logo + hamburger icon (three horizontal lines, `stroke-[#C8D8F0]`, `strokeWidth={1.5}`)
- Hamburger toggles a full-width dropdown panel in `bg-[#0E0F12]` with `border-b border-[#1C1E26]`
- Inside the dropdown: nav links stacked vertically, `py-3 px-4` each, `text-[#8892A4]` Inter, `border-b border-[#1C1E26]`
- "Enter The Foundry" CTA button at the bottom of dropdown, full width
- Close on outside click or link tap
- Navbar itself: `px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-12`, `h-14 md:h-16`

**3. HERO SECTION — scale the headline down**

```
text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl
```

Add `break-words` to the H1 to prevent overflow on narrow screens. The subheadline:

```
text-base md:text-xl lg:text-2xl
```

Body paragraph: add `max-w-full md:max-w-xl`. Trust bar below CTAs should wrap with `flex-wrap gap-2`.

CTA buttons: your `flex-col sm:flex-row` is already correct. Keep it.

Hero glow: reduce radius on mobile — `200px` blur at `3% opacity` max. Already restrained enough that this barely changes.

---

**4. REALITY STATEMENT — the big stat numbers**

The three-column stat grid needs:

```
grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3
gap-8 md:gap-6
```

The stat numbers themselves (`64px` on desktop) need to scale:

```
text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl
```

On mobile, add a `border-b border-[#1C1E26] pb-8` to each column except the last to create visual separation since they stack vertically.

---

**5. ENGINE SECTION — three cards**

Cards grid:

```
grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3
gap-4 md:gap-6
```

Card padding:

```
p-5 md:p-6 lg:p-8
```

Card titles: `text-lg md:text-xl`. Labels stay `text-xs`. No changes needed to body text.

---

**6. ROADMAP — timeline**

The vertical timeline line needs to be hidden on mobile since phases stack vertically. On mobile replace the connecting line with a simpler left-border treatment:

- Each phase card gets `border-l-2` in `#1C1E26`
- Active phase (Phase 01) gets `border-l-2 border-[#C8D8F0]`
- Remove the horizontal connecting line entirely below `md:`

Grid:

```
grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4
gap-4 md:gap-6
```

Phase cards: `p-5 md:p-6`. Phase number label (`01`, `02`): `text-3xl md:text-4xl`.

---

**7. PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY — four blocks**

Grid:

```
grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2
gap-4 md:gap-6
```

On mobile each block stacks. The number (`01`–`04`) and tag should sit on the same row on mobile using `flex items-center justify-between`. This saves vertical space.

Card padding: `p-5 md:p-8`.

Spec lines (`✓ GDPR Enforced // ...`): these long strings will overflow on narrow screens. Split them into individual lines on mobile using `flex-col gap-1` instead of a single inline string.

---

**8. SPECIFICATIONS TABLE — data tables**

This is the hardest section to make responsive. Current `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` is correct but the tables themselves can overflow.

Inside each table: ensure all values use `break-words` or `truncate` with a tooltip. Table labels and values both `text-xs md:text-sm`. On mobile reduce inner padding to `px-3 py-2`.

Consider collapsing the four tables to a single-column accordion on mobile — each table header becomes a tap-to-expand row. This is the cleanest treatment for dense spec data on a 375px screen.

---

**9. PRICING — four cards**

Current `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3` doesn't account for the Enterprise tier. Use:

```
grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4
gap-4 md:gap-6
```

On mobile, the Founder Access card (most deployed) should still visually stand out — keep its `border-t-2 border-[#C8D8F0]` since that works at all widths. Card padding: `p-5 md:p-6 lg:p-8`.

Price number: `text-3xl md:text-4xl`. Feature list items: `text-xs md:text-sm`, reduce `gap-2` to `gap-1.5` on mobile.

---

**10. FAQ ACCORDION**

Accordion works well on mobile natively. The only changes:

- Question text: `text-sm md:text-base`, Geist, tight tracking
- Answer text: `text-sm`, Inter, Coolant Gray — already correct
- Tap target height: ensure each closed row is at least `h-14` so it's thumb-friendly
- Add `px-0` to remove any inner horizontal padding that might cause text overflow

---

**11. FOOTER**

Change the main footer layout from grid to:

```
flex flex-col md:flex-row
gap-10 md:gap-16
```

On mobile: logo and tagline first, then nav links in a `flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-2` row, then status/contact/copyright stacked.

Copyright line: `text-xs`, full width, `border-t border-[#1C1E26] mt-8 pt-6`.

---

**12. GLOBAL RULES TO ADD ONCE**

Add these to your global CSS or Tailwind base layer:

```css
* { -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; }
html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }
body { overflow-x: hidden; }
```

The `overflow-x: hidden` on body is the single most important global fix — it prevents any component that slightly overflows from creating a horizontal scroll on mobile.

---

**Priority order if you implement these one at a time:**

First: page wrapper gap + `overflow-x: hidden`. Second: navbar hamburger. Third: hero headline scaling. Fourth: footer flex direction. Everything else is refinement. The first four will eliminate 90% of the broken experience on mobile.
