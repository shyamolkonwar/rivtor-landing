━━━ COLOR SYSTEM · COLD FUSION ━━━

BACKGROUNDS:
  Reactor Black      #060608  →  Main background
  Shielded Surface   #0E0F12  →  Cards, panels, data tables
  Containment Line   #1C1E26  →  Borders, dividers

TYPOGRAPHY:
  Chromium White     #F4F6FB  →  H1 headlines, primary data
  Coolant Gray       #8892A4  →  Body text, secondary, labels

ACCENT:
  Liquid Chromium    #C8D8F0  →  CTA buttons, active indicators ONLY. 10% max.

━━━ CRITICAL PALETTE NOTE ━━━
  The Liquid Chromium accent (#C8D8F0) is deliberately pale — almost a silver-blue.
  It is not electric. It does not pulse. It is the accent of a material, not a signal.
  This makes it the most restrained and premium-feeling palette on this list.
  It should feel like brushed aluminum under controlled lighting. CERN. Lockheed.

  #00FF85  →  #C8D8F0   (Plasma Green → Liquid Chromium)

━━━ PALETTE-SPECIFIC DESIGN NOTES ━━━
  Hero glow: #C8D8F0 at 3% opacity maximum. Very small radius (300px). It should
             read as a faint ambient reflection, not a glow effect.

  CTA Button "Enter The Foundry": bg #C8D8F0, text #060608. The pale accent on
  near-black creates a sense of cold metal being pressed — not a digital button.

  "MOST DEPLOYED" badge: #C8D8F0 at 8% opacity bg, #C8D8F0 text. Border: 1px #C8D8F0.

  Card hover: border transitions from #1C1E26 to #C8D8F0 at 25% opacity. Very slow (400ms).

  Dot-grid texture: #1C1E26 at 4% opacity. Slightly more visible than other palettes
  because the overall contrast is more muted — the texture adds depth without competing.

  Status dots ("● LIVE"): #C8D8F0. They should look like indicator lights on
  precision instrumentation, not digital badges.

  This palette rewards patience. At first glance it appears minimal to the point of
  austerity. On closer inspection, the chromium accent is everywhere — in borders,
  in status indicators, in the glow — but so restrained that it reads as material
  quality rather than color. That is the point.
