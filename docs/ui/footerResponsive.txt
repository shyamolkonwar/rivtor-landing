1. Move to a Stacked Layout
On mobile, stop using flex-row or a grid with multiple columns. Instead, stack your link categories vertically.
Center Alignment: While your brand is minimalist, a left-aligned footer can feel "broken" if there is too much whitespace on the right. Try centering the logo and the link groups.
The "Grouped Stack":
Logo & Tagline (Top)
Product Links
Company Links
Resources Links
Legal & Copyright (Bottom)
2. Implement Accordions (Optional but Recommended)
Since you mentioned there are "too many links," you can use a minimalist accordion for each category (Product, Company, Resources).
Show only the Category Name and a small + icon.
This collapses the footer height from 500px to maybe 150px, making the page feel much cleaner.
3. Improve the Information Architecture
You can actually reduce the visual "noise" without deleting links:
Social Icons: Instead of text links for "X" or "LinkedIn," use small, high-quality monochrome icons in a single row.
Secondary Links: Move "Privacy Policy" and "Terms" to a single horizontal line at the very bottom in a smaller font size (e.g., text-xs).
